# Favorite Git Branching 
1.
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph --all
   ```
This command displays a simplified, visual history of all commits across all branches, with a graphic representation of branch forks and merges.
Why it’s useful: It’s perfect for seeing how branches develop and merge over time, especially in projects with multiple branch.

2.
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
allows you to temporarily save changes without committing, which is useful if you're in the middle of work and need to switch branches quickly.
Why it’s useful: It helps keep your working area clean, and you can return to the saved changes later without losing them.


# Oh My Git.
1.

```bash
   git rebase
   ```
Command helps you reorder and organize your commits into a cleaner timeline.
Why it's interesting: In the game, you can see how the commits rearrange and how the Git history structure changes, making it much easier to understand rebasing rather than just reading about it.
2.
```bash
   git cherry-pick
   ```
This command lets you pick a specific commit from another branch and apply it to the branch you’re currently working on.
Why it's interesting: becomes a very visual command where you see the commit "jump" from one branch to another, helping you understand how to bring specific changes across branches without merging entire branches.
